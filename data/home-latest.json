          "rawSummary": "“Today’s agents might already be more capable than all three of us here in the room,” says Akshay Kothari, cofounder and chief operating officer of the $11 billion productivity startup Notion . “Taste is something we think is pretty unique to Notion, but you can imagine agents getting pretty good at that too. Eventually, the only thing left for humans is agency.” That idea might sound outrageous to most people, but it will come as no surprise to many in Silicon Valley . A viral Harper&#x27;s essay brought the subject to a head recently. It followed a few young people in San Francisco and concluded that being agentic has less to do with productivity and “more to do with constantly chasing attention online.” But in my conversations with founders, researchers, and investors, I came to a different conclusion. The tech industry is grappling with a very real shift in how software engineers do their jobs. Millions of developers are using AI coding agents like Claude Code and Codex to automate much of their work (some tech companies are even requiring it ). For many, a massive piece of their value is now tied to deciding what AI coding agents should work on. The shift is unsettling to those who enjoyed the act of sitting down and actually writing code, but for some of the industry’s most “agentic,” it’s an opportunity. Simon Last, another Notion cofounder, uses AI coding agents more than anyone I’ve ever met. He coded for nearly two decades—then abruptly stopped. Now, he’s using up to four AI coding agents at any given time (he prefers Codex to Claude Code). If he’s at a party or sleeping, Last gets what he calls “token anxiety” if he doesn’t have agents working in the background. He doesn’t like to use more than four, though, because he says it causes “context overload” on his human brain. “Knowing how to harness these agents is now the most important skill in the world, and it’s not really something you can train for,” says Last. “You have to be very open-minded, curious, and willing to try whatever the newest thing is. The value of that sort of person is going up exponentially, because the value they can create, by extension, is going up exponentially.” To be fair, Last is kind of describing himself. He acts as a “super IC” for Notion, and he doesn’t manage humans, only agents. But the way he manages them is not unlike how a manager oversees employees. Last is constantly delegating work to AI agents, then closely reviewing and fixing their code. Kothari says Notion has always hired people with high agency, but the value of doing so has gone up dramatically in recent months. Even though the company is using AI agents to automate work, Notion is busier than ever. Employees are shipping products at a higher velocity and doing more work overall, the cofounders claim. Notion isn’t downsizing its team because of AI, but it is hiring differently. “There&#x27;s more value in the Valley today to have a few Simons than thousands of engineers,” says Kothari. He says the people Notion hires need to understand “the new way of working.” If you’re not a software engineer, this can be a little hard to process. AI agents aren’t very useful for people in many industries. A recent survey from Gallup found that most Americans still don’t use AI much in their jobs , though the number of people who do is rising. Kothari is increasingly convinced the “new way of work” will eventually hit finance, legal, creative, and other industries. If and when that happens, you can imagine more Americans beginning to ask themselves, am I agentic? Jennifer Li, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz who works on the AI infrastructure team, says it’s hard to find a company she’s invested in where employees don’t use AI coding tools. “If we do come across people who are oblivious to it, it’s a big red flag. It impacts how we think about picking founders.” Of course, Li notes that just because you use a lot of AI agents doesn’t make you a “high-agency” person—ideally you’re using them in a smart way. Some engineers who work on highly sophisticated infrastructure systems can’t use AI coding agents much, she adds. For teams that are using them, there’s a “no slop rule”: the person who submitted the code is still responsible if it’s wrong.",

          "rawSummary": "Research suggests that responding to minor social mishaps with humor rather than embarrassment significantly boosts how others perceive your warmth and authenticity. Credit: Neuroscience News Laughing at Your Blunders Beats Embarrassment Featured Neuroscience Psychology &middot; March 1, 2026 Summary: We often think that acting embarrassed after a social stumble—like tripping or misnaming a colleague—shows humility and respect for social norms. However, a new study suggests that for minor, harmless mistakes, laughing at yourself is a far more effective reputational recovery strategy. Across six experiments with over 3,000 participants, researchers found that people who laugh at their own blunders are perceived as warmer, more competent, and more authentic than those who display traditional embarrassment. When you make a small mistake that doesn’t harm anyone else – such as tripping over a curb or misremembering a name – people will like you more if you can laugh at yourself rather than act embarrassed, finds research published by the American Psychological Association. “Our findings suggest that people often overestimate how harshly others judge their minor social mistakes,” said study co-author Övül Sezer, PhD, of the Cornell University SC Johnson School of Business. “For minor, harmless blunders, laughing at yourself can signal social confidence, reduce tension and communicate that the mistake was accidental.” The study was published in the&nbsp; Journal of Personality and Social Psychology . Prior research has found there are social benefits to acting embarrassed after committing a faux pas – people like to see embarrassment because it signals remorse and respect for social norms, according to Sezer.&nbsp; “But in everyday life, we often see another response &#8212; people laugh at themselves. We wanted to understand whether laughing at yourself might sometimes be even more effective than showing embarrassment – and if so, when,” she said.&nbsp; In six online experiments with more than 3,000 total participants, researchers asked participants to read about other people’s embarrassing mishaps, such as walking into a glass door at a party or accidentally waving to the wrong person at the theatre. Participants were then shown how the people in the stories reacted. In some experiments, they were told that the people acted embarrassed or that they laughed at themselves; in other experiments they were shown pictures of embarrassed-looking or laughing people. Overall, participants judged the people who laughed at their own minor blunders to be warmer, more competent and more authentic than those who acted embarrassed.",

          "rawSummary": "By monitoring brainwaves with EEG scans, researchers found that while participants reported being &#8220;full&#8221; and showed no conscious desire for more food, their brains refused to &#8220;devalue&#8221; the rewarding sight of snacks. This suggests that food-rich environments can trigger overeating by overriding the body’s natural appetite controls. Research from the University of East Anglia (UEA) may finally explain why we still reach for the biscuit tin, even when we’re full. A new study reveals that the human brain continues to respond to tempting food cues even after we’ve eaten enough. In a world of endless adverts and snack cues on every corner, the team say their findings shed light on why so many of us struggle to maintain a healthy weight. ew research reveals that the brain&#8217;s reward system ignores satiety signals, continuing to value food cues even when hunger is absent. Credit: Neuroscience News Lead researcher Dr Thomas Sambrook, from UEA’s School of Psychology, said: “Obesity has become a major worldwide health crisis. But rising obesity isn’t simply about willpower &#8211; it’s a sign that our food-rich environments and learned responses to mouth-watering cues are overpowering the body’s natural appetite controls. “We wanted to better understand how our brains react to food cues when we are already feeling full. “We studied people’s brainwaves after eating and found that even though their stomachs might be satisfied, their brains didn’t seem to care. “In fact, no amount of fullness could switch off the brain&#8217;s response to delicious looking food. This suggests that food cues may trigger overeating in the absence of hunger.” In the study, 76 volunteers were monitored using Electroencephalogram (EEG) brain scans as they played a reward‑based learning game with food such as sweets, chocolate, crisps and popcorn. Halfway through the task, participants were given a meal of one of the foods until they didn’t want another bite.",
