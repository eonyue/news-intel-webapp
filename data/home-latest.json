          "rawSummary": "By monitoring brainwaves with EEG scans, researchers found that while participants reported being &#8220;full&#8221; and showed no conscious desire for more food, their brains refused to &#8220;devalue&#8221; the rewarding sight of snacks. This suggests that food-rich environments can trigger overeating by overriding the body’s natural appetite controls. Research from the University of East Anglia (UEA) may finally explain why we still reach for the biscuit tin, even when we’re full. A new study reveals that the human brain continues to respond to tempting food cues even after we’ve eaten enough. In a world of endless adverts and snack cues on every corner, the team say their findings shed light on why so many of us struggle to maintain a healthy weight. ew research reveals that the brain&#8217;s reward system ignores satiety signals, continuing to value food cues even when hunger is absent. Credit: Neuroscience News Lead researcher Dr Thomas Sambrook, from UEA’s School of Psychology, said: “Obesity has become a major worldwide health crisis. But rising obesity isn’t simply about willpower &#8211; it’s a sign that our food-rich environments and learned responses to mouth-watering cues are overpowering the body’s natural appetite controls. “We wanted to better understand how our brains react to food cues when we are already feeling full. “We studied people’s brainwaves after eating and found that even though their stomachs might be satisfied, their brains didn’t seem to care. “In fact, no amount of fullness could switch off the brain&#8217;s response to delicious looking food. This suggests that food cues may trigger overeating in the absence of hunger.” In the study, 76 volunteers were monitored using Electroencephalogram (EEG) brain scans as they played a reward‑based learning game with food such as sweets, chocolate, crisps and popcorn. Halfway through the task, participants were given a meal of one of the foods until they didn’t want another bite.",

          "rawSummary": "Study Reveals What Tau PET Scans Are Actually Seeing Featured Neurology Neuroscience &middot; February 28, 2026 Summary: While tau PET scans are vital for &#8220;seeing&#8221; Alzheimer’s biology in living patients, they have a known quirk: the most common tracer, Flortaucipir (Tauvid), often &#8220;lights up&#8221; even when tau tangles aren&#8217;t the primary driver. In a high-precision study, researchers used AI-enabled, voxel-by-voxel alignment to compare PET scans directly with postmortem brain tissue. They discovered that in non-Alzheimer’s cases and even some controls, the PET signal was actually reacting to iron deposits and MAO-B (a marker of neuroinflammation) rather than tau itself. This &#8220;off-target&#8221; binding explains why scans can sometimes over-predict the presence of toxic tangles. Tau proteins play an important role in Alzheimer’s disease. Tau helps to stabilize neurons in the brain, but in Alzheimer’s disease, tau proteins can misfold and tangle inside neurons. These tangles spread across the brain forming toxic clumps that impair neuronal function and ultimately lead to cell death. PET scans are one of the few ways that clinicians and researchers can “see” Alzheimer’s disease biology in a living person. PET scans for tau are being increasingly used in specialty clinics and research to estimate the burden and distribution of tau tangles, providing information that can influence diagnostic confidence, prognosis discussions, and how patients are selected for novel Alzheimer’s therapies and tracked in Alzheimer’s drug trials. ?Researchers identified that iron and neuroinflammation can mimic tau pathology on PET scans, providing a roadmap for more accurate diagnostic interpretation. Credit: Neuroscience News At the same time, there is an important limitation to tau PET scans: the most widely used tau PET tracer (Flortaucipir/Tauvid) can also bind to other biological features &nbsp; in the&nbsp;brain, sometimes showing a low-level signal on scans even when tau is not the main driver of the results. This is especially true in non-Alzheimer’s disorders, where tau protein accumulations show a different structure than in Alzheimer’s disease. In a study appearing February 25 in Acta Neuropathologica , UC San Francisco researchers use a rare combination of patient tau PET imaging plus detailed postmortem brain tissue mapping, to clarify the extent to which non-tau factors influence the Flortaucipir tracer signal. With the aid of AI-enabled, voxel-by-voxel alignment between the PET scan and microscopy, the researchers computationally matched the PET signal to the corresponding tissue location and generated thousands of point-by-point comparisons per person, giving much higher anatomical precision than typical PET–autopsy studies. They then measured, side-by-side, the tissue features most relevant to interpreting flortaucipir: phospho-tau (tau pathology), ferric iron deposits and MAO-B, a marker linked to reactive astrocytes which are a key component of neuroinflammation. They found that in several non-Alzheimer’s tauopathies (and in a non-tau control case), the PET signal was better explained by iron and/or MAO-B–related processes than by tau itself. “Our results help explain&nbsp; why &nbsp;tau PET scans sometimes ‘light up’ beyond what tau pathology alone would predict,” says co-senior author Lea T. Grinberg, MD, PhD, a former UCSF neuroscientist and current professor of Neuroscience at the Mayo Clinic .“In Alzheimer’s disease, tau is a major contributor to flortaucipir signal—but not the only one.” The researchers believe these findings can help clinicians avoid over-interpretation of borderline signal in a tau PET scan and improve how scans are used for prognosis and trial decisions.",
