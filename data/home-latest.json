          "rawSummary": "Vitamin K Refusal Puts Newborns at High Risk for Brain Injury Featured Neurology Neuroscience &middot; February 26, 2026 Summary: Newborns are naturally born with low levels of vitamin K, which is essential for blood clotting. To prevent life-threatening bleeding, infants are typically given a vitamin K shot at birth. However, a systematic review reveals a concerning trend: more parents are refusing this essential supplement. Babies who do not receive the shot are 81 times more likely to develop &#8220;vitamin K deficiency bleeding,&#8221; a condition that often leads to brain hemorrhages, permanent neurological disability, or death. Researchers noted that this trend is often linked to broader healthcare hesitancy and inaccurate information. Increasing numbers of parents are refusing vitamin K shots for their newborns, putting infants at greater risk of avoidable brain injuries, according to a preliminary systematic review released February 26, 2026, that will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology’s 78 th Annual Meeting taking place April 18-22, 2026, in Chicago and online. A vitamin K injection is a supplement that provides babies with an essential vitamin that is naturally low in newborns. It is not a vaccine. Vitamin K is needed to help blood clot. Getting a vitamin K shot right after birth can prevent a rare but serious condition called vitamin K deficiency bleeding. Research confirms that the vitamin K injection at birth is a vital safeguard against preventable brain hemorrhages and lifelong neurological disability. Credit: Neuroscience News This condition can cause an intracerebral hemorrhage, a type of stroke, when a blood vessel bursts in the brain. It can lead to death or lifelong brain problems. “Vitamin K at birth is safe and effective, and while refusal is still uncommon with rates in the United States remaining under 1% in most hospitals, our review found in recent years, there have been increases in parents refusing this supplement for their newborns,” said study author Kate Semidey, MD, of Florida International University in Miami. “This trend is concerning because our review also found that babies who do not get the vitamin K injection are 81 times more likely to develop vitamin K deficiency bleeding.” For the review, researchers looked at 25 studies with two decades of global data. The studies examined vitamin K refusal, the incidence of vitamin K deficiency bleeding and outcomes, parent reasons for refusal and possible links to vaccine refusal. Researchers found in Minnesota, refusal rates rose from 0.9% in 2015 to 1.6% in 2019. In California, Connecticut, and Iowa, refusal ranged from 0.2% to 1.3% in 2018 and 2019, with over half of hospital staff perceiving increases. Internationally, refusal rates ranged from 1% to 3% in Canada, New Zealand and Scotland, and more than 30% in some birthing centers.",

In 2026, however, AI’s role is evolving from exploration to orchestration.

          "rawSummary": "That’s front and center in a brand new survey of current tech trends that IBM is releasing for 2026 under the banner: “The trends that will shape AI and tech in 2026.” Staff writer Annabelle Nicoud takes us through a dizzying array of advances that will certainly grab headlines in the year to come. One is quantum computing and its obvious boost to overall digital brain-power. The utilities of quantum over classical computing are evident, and I’ve seen IBM actually focus on this through 2024 and 2025. But one of the more interesting components here is the emergence of what Nicoud calls “super-agents.” What does that mean? ## The Super-Agent at Work [...] And how do the super-agents do this? A major part of the answer is that the super-agent isn’t really just one agent: it’s a series of agents working together to accomplish broader goals. IBM Chief Architect of AI Open Innovation Gabe Goodhart explains: “If you go to ChatGPT, you are not talking to an AI model … You are talking to a software system that includes tools for searching the web, doing all sorts of different individual scripted programmatic tasks, and most likely an agentic loop.” That’s true for the super-agent, too. [...] What does that mean? ## The Super-Agent at Work Well, agentic AI means AI can do tasks. The first agents were the most primitive. They could, say, create a poem or a song, or an image, or use a web site to make some transaction, but they were, in a sense, specialists. They were single-use. MORE FOR YOU The idea with super-agents is that they will be able to move in a digital environment, analyze a system, navigate processes, and even supply their own insights. Not only supply their own insights, but work on the basis of those insights, in ways that don’t really require any substantial human supervision. So you might wake up to find that AI has written a poem or a song, or done some transaction, without your express request. That’s part of the whole ball of wax.",
