          "rawSummary": "Vitamin K Refusal Puts Newborns at High Risk for Brain Injury Featured Neurology Neuroscience &middot; February 26, 2026 Summary: Newborns are naturally born with low levels of vitamin K, which is essential for blood clotting. To prevent life-threatening bleeding, infants are typically given a vitamin K shot at birth. However, a systematic review reveals a concerning trend: more parents are refusing this essential supplement. Babies who do not receive the shot are 81 times more likely to develop &#8220;vitamin K deficiency bleeding,&#8221; a condition that often leads to brain hemorrhages, permanent neurological disability, or death. Researchers noted that this trend is often linked to broader healthcare hesitancy and inaccurate information. Increasing numbers of parents are refusing vitamin K shots for their newborns, putting infants at greater risk of avoidable brain injuries, according to a preliminary systematic review released February 26, 2026, that will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology’s 78 th Annual Meeting taking place April 18-22, 2026, in Chicago and online. A vitamin K injection is a supplement that provides babies with an essential vitamin that is naturally low in newborns. It is not a vaccine. Vitamin K is needed to help blood clot. Getting a vitamin K shot right after birth can prevent a rare but serious condition called vitamin K deficiency bleeding. Research confirms that the vitamin K injection at birth is a vital safeguard against preventable brain hemorrhages and lifelong neurological disability. Credit: Neuroscience News This condition can cause an intracerebral hemorrhage, a type of stroke, when a blood vessel bursts in the brain. It can lead to death or lifelong brain problems. “Vitamin K at birth is safe and effective, and while refusal is still uncommon with rates in the United States remaining under 1% in most hospitals, our review found in recent years, there have been increases in parents refusing this supplement for their newborns,” said study author Kate Semidey, MD, of Florida International University in Miami. “This trend is concerning because our review also found that babies who do not get the vitamin K injection are 81 times more likely to develop vitamin K deficiency bleeding.” For the review, researchers looked at 25 studies with two decades of global data. The studies examined vitamin K refusal, the incidence of vitamin K deficiency bleeding and outcomes, parent reasons for refusal and possible links to vaccine refusal. Researchers found in Minnesota, refusal rates rose from 0.9% in 2015 to 1.6% in 2019. In California, Connecticut, and Iowa, refusal ranged from 0.2% to 1.3% in 2018 and 2019, with over half of hospital staff perceiving increases. Internationally, refusal rates ranged from 1% to 3% in Canada, New Zealand and Scotland, and more than 30% in some birthing centers.",

          "rawSummary": "By monitoring brainwaves with EEG scans, researchers found that while participants reported being &#8220;full&#8221; and showed no conscious desire for more food, their brains refused to &#8220;devalue&#8221; the rewarding sight of snacks. This suggests that food-rich environments can trigger overeating by overriding the body’s natural appetite controls. Research from the University of East Anglia (UEA) may finally explain why we still reach for the biscuit tin, even when we’re full. A new study reveals that the human brain continues to respond to tempting food cues even after we’ve eaten enough. In a world of endless adverts and snack cues on every corner, the team say their findings shed light on why so many of us struggle to maintain a healthy weight. ew research reveals that the brain&#8217;s reward system ignores satiety signals, continuing to value food cues even when hunger is absent. Credit: Neuroscience News Lead researcher Dr Thomas Sambrook, from UEA’s School of Psychology, said: “Obesity has become a major worldwide health crisis. But rising obesity isn’t simply about willpower &#8211; it’s a sign that our food-rich environments and learned responses to mouth-watering cues are overpowering the body’s natural appetite controls. “We wanted to better understand how our brains react to food cues when we are already feeling full. “We studied people’s brainwaves after eating and found that even though their stomachs might be satisfied, their brains didn’t seem to care. “In fact, no amount of fullness could switch off the brain&#8217;s response to delicious looking food. This suggests that food cues may trigger overeating in the absence of hunger.” In the study, 76 volunteers were monitored using Electroencephalogram (EEG) brain scans as they played a reward‑based learning game with food such as sweets, chocolate, crisps and popcorn. Halfway through the task, participants were given a meal of one of the foods until they didn’t want another bite.",

Image David Ruau ## AI in life sciences News ### FDA maps new regulatory route for ultra-rare diseases [...] # AI scientists and the robotic labs of tomorrow Digital The life sciences are entering a decisive new phase. Over the past decade, artificial intelligence (AI) has proven its value as a powerful tool, helping researchers analyse vast datasets, surface hidden patterns, and accelerate individual stages of discovery. In 2026, however, AI’s role is evolving from exploration to orchestration. Rather than supporting isolated tasks, AI scientists – systems of agents that can work autonomously alongside human scientists – are already becoming essential collaborators embedded across the research lifecycle, fundamentally reshaping how innovation happens in healthcare and beyond. [...] ## AI scientists become core collaborators As 2026 progresses, AI scientists will no longer operate at the margins of life sciences research. Instead, they will become essential collaborators in the labs of tomorrow, working alongside human scientists and other AI-scientist platforms and established tools to co-author discovery itself. These AI systems will propose novel targets and molecular structures, simulate biological behaviour across complex virtual networks, suggest possible indication expansion and help direct both digital and physical experiments.",
