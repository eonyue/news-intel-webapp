As he put it, AI models are pushing against three frontiers at once: raw intelligence, response time, and a third quality that has less to do with raw capability than with cost — whether a model can be deployed cheaply enough to run at massive, unpredictable scale. It’s a new way of thinking about model capabilities, and a particularly valuable one for anyone trying to push frontier models in a new direction.

As LLMs increasingly mediate online communication, their potential to foster empathy and constructive dialogue becomes an important frontier for responsible AI research. This work explores whether LLMs can serve not only as moderators that detect harmful content, but as mediators capable of understanding and de-escalating online conflicts. Our framework decomposes mediation into two subtasks: judgment, where an LLM evaluates the fairness and emotional dynamics of a conversation, and steering, where it generates empathetic, de-escalatory messages to guide participants toward resolution. To assess mediation quality, we construct a large Reddit-based dataset and propose a multi-stage evaluation pipeline combining principle-based scoring, user simulation, and human comparison. Experiments show that API-based models outperform open-source counterparts in both reasoning and intervention alignment when doing mediation. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current LLMs as emerging agents for online social mediation.",

Many studies capture behavior with cameras, but video analysis approaches typically rely on specialized models requiring extensive labeled data. We address this limitation with BEAST(BEhavioral Analysis via Self-supervised pretraining of Transformers), a novel and scalable framework that pretrains experiment-specific vision transformers for diverse neuro-behavior analyses. BEAST combines masked autoencoding with temporal contrastive learning to effectively leverage unlabeled video data. Through comprehensive evaluation across multiple species, we demonstrate improved performance in three critical neuro-behavioral tasks: extracting behavioral features that correlate with neural activity, and pose estimation and action segmentation in both the single- and multi-animal settings. Our method establishes a powerful and versatile backbone model that accelerates behavioral analysis in scenarios where labeled data remains scarce.",

However, fine-tuning on user logs inadvertently encodes sensitive attributes into model parameters, raising critical privacy concerns. Existing Machine Unlearning (MU) techniques struggle to navigate this tension due to the Polysemy Dilemma, where neurons superimpose sensitive data with general reasoning patterns, leading to catastrophic utility loss under traditional gradient or pruning methods. To address this, we propose Utility-aware Contrastive AttenuatioN (U-CAN), a precision unlearning framework that operates on low-rank adapters. U-CAN quantifies risk by contrasting activations and focuses on neurons with asymmetric responses that are highly sensitive to the forgetting set but suppressed on the retention set. To safeguard performance, we introduce a utility-aware calibration mechanism that combines weight magnitudes with retention-set activation norms, assigning higher utility scores to dimensions that contribute strongly to retention performance. Unlike binary pruning, which often fragments network structure, U-CAN develop adaptive soft attenuation with a differentiable decay function to selectively down-scale high-risk parameters on LoRA adapters, suppressing sensitive retrieval pathways and preserving the topological connectivity of reasoning circuits. Experiments on two public datasets across seven metrics demonstrate that U-CAN achieves strong privacy forgetting, utility retention, and computational efficiency.",

This paper introduces the first large-scale MCP dataset featuring diverse, high-quality diverse user queries generated specifically to match 2800 tools across 308 MCP servers, developing on the MCP Zero dataset.

          "rawSummary": "arXiv:2602.23440v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Training large language models to reason with search engines via reinforcement learning is hindered by a fundamental credit assignment problem: existing methods such as Search-R1 provide only a sparse outcome reward after an entire multi-step trajectory, making it infeasible to attribute success or failure to individual reasoning and retrieval decisions. Process-reward methods like StepSearch alleviate this by introducing step-level supervision, but rely on heuristic rewards such as TF-IDF overlap with gold documents, and still sample k complete trajectories per example, retaining high gradient variance. We propose SLATE, a framework built on two complementary ideas: (1) truncated step-level sampling, which generates k trajectories that share a common prefix and differ only at the next step, and (2) dense LLM-as-judge rewards, which replace heuristic scoring with a capable LLM evaluator that assesses the quality of each reasoning step, search query, and answer, providing richer and more reliable supervision. We theoretically prove that under the same dense reward structure, truncated sampling reduces the variance of advantage estimates by up to a factor of T compared to full-trajectory sampling for T-step trajectories, yielding lower-variance, better-targeted policy gradients. Experiments on seven QA benchmarks confirm that SLATE consistently outperforms both sparse-reward and process-reward baselines, with the largest gains on harder multi-hop tasks and smaller models.",

Meanwhile, rapidly growing reference lists make manual verification impractical, and existing automated tools remain fragile to noisy and heterogeneous citation formats and lack standardized evaluation. We present the first comprehensive benchmark and detection framework for hallucinated citations in scientific writing. Our multi-agent verification pipeline decomposes citation checking into claim extraction, evidence retrieval, passage matching, reasoning, and calibrated judgment to assess whether a cited source truly supports its claim. We construct a large-scale human-validated dataset across domains and define unified metrics for citation faithfulness and evidence alignment. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs reveal substantial citation errors and show that our framework significantly outperforms prior methods in both accuracy and interpretability. This work provides the first scalable infrastructure for auditing citations in the LLM era and practical tools to improve the trustworthiness of scientific references.",

It studies how systems evolve over time and reduces thousands of variables into compact equations that still capture real behavior. The method works across physics, engineering, climate science, and biology. Researchers say it could help scientists understand systems where traditional equations are missing or too complicated to write down.",

          "rawSummary": "Pharma biotools VC deal activity rebounded in 2025, with deal value reaching $5.7 billion and deal count surging to a record 537—signaling renewed investor confidence after three years of contraction. [...] The pharma biotools sector regained momentum in 2025 as venture funding rebounded following three years of contraction, driven by investor appetite for asset-light business models and AI-enabled technologies that support drug discovery and development. Deal value rose modestly for the year and remained stable in Q4, signaling a normalization of activity rather than renewed decline. Investment concentrated heavily in generative AI, quantum computing, microfluidics, and synthetic biology, as companies delivering high-fidelity data generation, automation, and software-like services attracted outsized interest. Major Q4 financings for AI-driven protein design platforms and automation-focused tools underscored how investors are backing the emerging “scientific stack” that connects [...] M&A activity remained subdued, although Halozyme Therapeutics’ acquisition of Elektrofi for up to $900 million marked the sector’s largest exit since 2021 and highlighted continued demand for technologies embedded in biologics delivery and manufacturing workflows. China also emerged as a key growth market, with deal count rising more than 80% YoY and investment concentrated in AI-driven platforms and enabling infrastructure for next-generation therapeutics. Overall, pharma biotools VC activity is stabilizing as investors prioritize platforms capable of generating high-quality datasets, enabling automation, and accelerating commercialization across the broader biopharma ecosystem.
