Because AI models are frequently updated, performance may change over time, underscoring the need for independent evaluation, the researchers say.",

By translating high-level scientific goals into executable protocols, LLM-based agents lower the barrier to automation and free researchers from low-level robotic programming. However, because such models can be error-prone, hybrid systems enforce guardrails: clear decision tiers, human checkpoints for out-of-range results, and comprehensive audit trails compatible with regulatory standards. Scaling up remains the biggest hurdle. While self-driving labs excel at micro- to laboratory-scale experimentation, autonomy becomes less practical at pilot and manufacturing scales. Here, digital twins and uncertainty-aware optimization help bridge bench and plant, but human-in-the-loop control remains essential. [...] Home Topics Artificial Intelligence Autonomy and Accountability in Bioprocessing # Autonomy and Accountability in Bioprocessing By Mike May, PhD Credit: Google Gemini Artificial intelligence (AI) is moving from offline analysis into the laboratory itself, reshaping how experiments are designed, executed, and interpreted. In chemistry and materials science, autonomous platforms already run closed-loop discovery cycles. In the life sciences, breakthroughs like protein-structure prediction and AI-guided drug discovery highlight AI’s transformative potential. Yet in bioprocess engineering, the path to autonomy is less straightforward.",

          "rawSummary": "Vitamin K Refusal Puts Newborns at High Risk for Brain Injury Featured Neurology Neuroscience &middot; February 26, 2026 Summary: Newborns are naturally born with low levels of vitamin K, which is essential for blood clotting. To prevent life-threatening bleeding, infants are typically given a vitamin K shot at birth. However, a systematic review reveals a concerning trend: more parents are refusing this essential supplement. Babies who do not receive the shot are 81 times more likely to develop &#8220;vitamin K deficiency bleeding,&#8221; a condition that often leads to brain hemorrhages, permanent neurological disability, or death. Researchers noted that this trend is often linked to broader healthcare hesitancy and inaccurate information. Increasing numbers of parents are refusing vitamin K shots for their newborns, putting infants at greater risk of avoidable brain injuries, according to a preliminary systematic review released February 26, 2026, that will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology’s 78 th Annual Meeting taking place April 18-22, 2026, in Chicago and online. A vitamin K injection is a supplement that provides babies with an essential vitamin that is naturally low in newborns. It is not a vaccine. Vitamin K is needed to help blood clot. Getting a vitamin K shot right after birth can prevent a rare but serious condition called vitamin K deficiency bleeding. Research confirms that the vitamin K injection at birth is a vital safeguard against preventable brain hemorrhages and lifelong neurological disability. Credit: Neuroscience News This condition can cause an intracerebral hemorrhage, a type of stroke, when a blood vessel bursts in the brain. It can lead to death or lifelong brain problems. “Vitamin K at birth is safe and effective, and while refusal is still uncommon with rates in the United States remaining under 1% in most hospitals, our review found in recent years, there have been increases in parents refusing this supplement for their newborns,” said study author Kate Semidey, MD, of Florida International University in Miami. “This trend is concerning because our review also found that babies who do not get the vitamin K injection are 81 times more likely to develop vitamin K deficiency bleeding.” For the review, researchers looked at 25 studies with two decades of global data. The studies examined vitamin K refusal, the incidence of vitamin K deficiency bleeding and outcomes, parent reasons for refusal and possible links to vaccine refusal. Researchers found in Minnesota, refusal rates rose from 0.9% in 2015 to 1.6% in 2019. In California, Connecticut, and Iowa, refusal ranged from 0.2% to 1.3% in 2018 and 2019, with over half of hospital staff perceiving increases. Internationally, refusal rates ranged from 1% to 3% in Canada, New Zealand and Scotland, and more than 30% in some birthing centers.",

With a background in computational biology, his work has focused on stem cell reprogramming and the electronic health records analysis across therapeutic areas. He previously held senior roles at Bayer, AstraZeneca, and a healthcare AI company, and has authored more than 30 peer-reviewed publications in leading journals including Nature, Cell, and Stem Cells. Image David Ruau ## AI in life sciences News ### FDA maps new regulatory route for ultra-rare diseases [...] ## AI scientists become core collaborators As 2026 progresses, AI scientists will no longer operate at the margins of life sciences research. Instead, they will become essential collaborators in the labs of tomorrow, working alongside human scientists and other AI-scientist platforms and established tools to co-author discovery itself. These AI systems will propose novel targets and molecular structures, simulate biological behaviour across complex virtual networks, suggest possible indication expansion and help direct both digital and physical experiments. [...] # AI scientists and the robotic labs of tomorrow Digital The life sciences are entering a decisive new phase. Over the past decade, artificial intelligence (AI) has proven its value as a powerful tool, helping researchers analyse vast datasets, surface hidden patterns, and accelerate individual stages of discovery. In 2026, however, AI’s role is evolving from exploration to orchestration. Rather than supporting isolated tasks, AI scientists – systems of agents that can work autonomously alongside human scientists – are already becoming essential collaborators embedded across the research lifecycle, fundamentally reshaping how innovation happens in healthcare and beyond.",

Takeaway: Expect a more hybrid neuroscience toolkit – genetics informed subgroups, iPSC phenotyping, and AI generated hypotheses – aligned around endpoints regulators and HTA bodies can accept. #### 9. Anti microbial resistance (AMR) and vaccines: Cautious optimism [...] Implications: Imaging departments and trial groups will need to harmonise protocols to capitalise on low dose agents and sensitive MRD readouts; sponsor teams should pre plan for diagnostic supply, reader training, and MRD anchored secondary endpoints. #### 5.

Translating platform science into the clinic Cellular rejuvenation enters human testing. Life Biosciences secured FDA IND clearance for ER 100, the first clinical-stage therapy using partial epigenetic reprogramming (OSK factors) to treat optic neuropathies (OAG and NAION). The first in human Phase 1 study (NCT07290244) starts in Q1, reflecting years of intravitreal preclinical work and controlled OSK expression readouts in primates. This is a defining moment for longevity modalities, and noteworthy for starting in ophthalmology – clear delivery route, functional end points, and manageable risk.",

Investment concentrated heavily in generative AI, quantum computing, microfluidics, and synthetic biology, as companies delivering high-fidelity data generation, automation, and software-like services attracted outsized interest. Major Q4 financings for AI-driven protein design platforms and automation-focused tools underscored how investors are backing the emerging “scientific stack” that connects [...] M&A activity remained subdued, although Halozyme Therapeutics’ acquisition of Elektrofi for up to $900 million marked the sector’s largest exit since 2021 and highlighted continued demand for technologies embedded in biologics delivery and manufacturing workflows. China also emerged as a key growth market, with deal count rising more than 80% YoY and investment concentrated in AI-driven platforms and enabling infrastructure for next-generation therapeutics. Overall, pharma biotools VC activity is stabilizing as investors prioritize platforms capable of generating high-quality datasets, enabling automation, and accelerating commercialization across the broader biopharma ecosystem.
