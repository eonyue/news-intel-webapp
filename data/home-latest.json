          "rawSummary": "“Today’s agents might already be more capable than all three of us here in the room,” says Akshay Kothari, cofounder and chief operating officer of the $11 billion productivity startup Notion . “Taste is something we think is pretty unique to Notion, but you can imagine agents getting pretty good at that too. Eventually, the only thing left for humans is agency.” That idea might sound outrageous to most people, but it will come as no surprise to many in Silicon Valley . A viral Harper&#x27;s essay brought the subject to a head recently. It followed a few young people in San Francisco and concluded that being agentic has less to do with productivity and “more to do with constantly chasing attention online.” But in my conversations with founders, researchers, and investors, I came to a different conclusion. The tech industry is grappling with a very real shift in how software engineers do their jobs. Millions of developers are using AI coding agents like Claude Code and Codex to automate much of their work (some tech companies are even requiring it ). For many, a massive piece of their value is now tied to deciding what AI coding agents should work on. The shift is unsettling to those who enjoyed the act of sitting down and actually writing code, but for some of the industry’s most “agentic,” it’s an opportunity. Simon Last, another Notion cofounder, uses AI coding agents more than anyone I’ve ever met. He coded for nearly two decades—then abruptly stopped. Now, he’s using up to four AI coding agents at any given time (he prefers Codex to Claude Code). If he’s at a party or sleeping, Last gets what he calls “token anxiety” if he doesn’t have agents working in the background. He doesn’t like to use more than four, though, because he says it causes “context overload” on his human brain. “Knowing how to harness these agents is now the most important skill in the world, and it’s not really something you can train for,” says Last. “You have to be very open-minded, curious, and willing to try whatever the newest thing is. The value of that sort of person is going up exponentially, because the value they can create, by extension, is going up exponentially.” To be fair, Last is kind of describing himself. He acts as a “super IC” for Notion, and he doesn’t manage humans, only agents. But the way he manages them is not unlike how a manager oversees employees. Last is constantly delegating work to AI agents, then closely reviewing and fixing their code. Kothari says Notion has always hired people with high agency, but the value of doing so has gone up dramatically in recent months. Even though the company is using AI agents to automate work, Notion is busier than ever. Employees are shipping products at a higher velocity and doing more work overall, the cofounders claim. Notion isn’t downsizing its team because of AI, but it is hiring differently. “There&#x27;s more value in the Valley today to have a few Simons than thousands of engineers,” says Kothari. He says the people Notion hires need to understand “the new way of working.” If you’re not a software engineer, this can be a little hard to process. AI agents aren’t very useful for people in many industries. A recent survey from Gallup found that most Americans still don’t use AI much in their jobs , though the number of people who do is rising. Kothari is increasingly convinced the “new way of work” will eventually hit finance, legal, creative, and other industries. If and when that happens, you can imagine more Americans beginning to ask themselves, am I agentic? Jennifer Li, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz who works on the AI infrastructure team, says it’s hard to find a company she’s invested in where employees don’t use AI coding tools. “If we do come across people who are oblivious to it, it’s a big red flag. It impacts how we think about picking founders.” Of course, Li notes that just because you use a lot of AI agents doesn’t make you a “high-agency” person—ideally you’re using them in a smart way. Some engineers who work on highly sophisticated infrastructure systems can’t use AI coding agents much, she adds. For teams that are using them, there’s a “no slop rule”: the person who submitted the code is still responsible if it’s wrong.",

This suggests that food-rich environments can trigger overeating by overriding the body’s natural appetite controls. Research from the University of East Anglia (UEA) may finally explain why we still reach for the biscuit tin, even when we’re full. A new study reveals that the human brain continues to respond to tempting food cues even after we’ve eaten enough. In a world of endless adverts and snack cues on every corner, the team say their findings shed light on why so many of us struggle to maintain a healthy weight. ew research reveals that the brain&#8217;s reward system ignores satiety signals, continuing to value food cues even when hunger is absent. Credit: Neuroscience News Lead researcher Dr Thomas Sambrook, from UEA’s School of Psychology, said: “Obesity has become a major worldwide health crisis. But rising obesity isn’t simply about willpower &#8211; it’s a sign that our food-rich environments and learned responses to mouth-watering cues are overpowering the body’s natural appetite controls. “We wanted to better understand how our brains react to food cues when we are already feeling full. “We studied people’s brainwaves after eating and found that even though their stomachs might be satisfied, their brains didn’t seem to care. “In fact, no amount of fullness could switch off the brain&#8217;s response to delicious looking food. This suggests that food cues may trigger overeating in the absence of hunger.” In the study, 76 volunteers were monitored using Electroencephalogram (EEG) brain scans as they played a reward‑based learning game with food such as sweets, chocolate, crisps and popcorn. Halfway through the task, participants were given a meal of one of the foods until they didn’t want another bite.",

          "rawSummary": "Study Reveals What Tau PET Scans Are Actually Seeing Featured Neurology Neuroscience &middot; February 28, 2026 Summary: While tau PET scans are vital for &#8220;seeing&#8221; Alzheimer’s biology in living patients, they have a known quirk: the most common tracer, Flortaucipir (Tauvid), often &#8220;lights up&#8221; even when tau tangles aren&#8217;t the primary driver. In a high-precision study, researchers used AI-enabled, voxel-by-voxel alignment to compare PET scans directly with postmortem brain tissue. They discovered that in non-Alzheimer’s cases and even some controls, the PET signal was actually reacting to iron deposits and MAO-B (a marker of neuroinflammation) rather than tau itself. This &#8220;off-target&#8221; binding explains why scans can sometimes over-predict the presence of toxic tangles. Tau proteins play an important role in Alzheimer’s disease. Tau helps to stabilize neurons in the brain, but in Alzheimer’s disease, tau proteins can misfold and tangle inside neurons. These tangles spread across the brain forming toxic clumps that impair neuronal function and ultimately lead to cell death. PET scans are one of the few ways that clinicians and researchers can “see” Alzheimer’s disease biology in a living person. PET scans for tau are being increasingly used in specialty clinics and research to estimate the burden and distribution of tau tangles, providing information that can influence diagnostic confidence, prognosis discussions, and how patients are selected for novel Alzheimer’s therapies and tracked in Alzheimer’s drug trials. ?Researchers identified that iron and neuroinflammation can mimic tau pathology on PET scans, providing a roadmap for more accurate diagnostic interpretation. Credit: Neuroscience News At the same time, there is an important limitation to tau PET scans: the most widely used tau PET tracer (Flortaucipir/Tauvid) can also bind to other biological features &nbsp; in the&nbsp;brain, sometimes showing a low-level signal on scans even when tau is not the main driver of the results. This is especially true in non-Alzheimer’s disorders, where tau protein accumulations show a different structure than in Alzheimer’s disease. In a study appearing February 25 in Acta Neuropathologica , UC San Francisco researchers use a rare combination of patient tau PET imaging plus detailed postmortem brain tissue mapping, to clarify the extent to which non-tau factors influence the Flortaucipir tracer signal. With the aid of AI-enabled, voxel-by-voxel alignment between the PET scan and microscopy, the researchers computationally matched the PET signal to the corresponding tissue location and generated thousands of point-by-point comparisons per person, giving much higher anatomical precision than typical PET–autopsy studies. They then measured, side-by-side, the tissue features most relevant to interpreting flortaucipir: phospho-tau (tau pathology), ferric iron deposits and MAO-B, a marker linked to reactive astrocytes which are a key component of neuroinflammation. They found that in several non-Alzheimer’s tauopathies (and in a non-tau control case), the PET signal was better explained by iron and/or MAO-B–related processes than by tau itself. “Our results help explain&nbsp; why &nbsp;tau PET scans sometimes ‘light up’ beyond what tau pathology alone would predict,” says co-senior author Lea T. Grinberg, MD, PhD, a former UCSF neuroscientist and current professor of Neuroscience at the Mayo Clinic .“In Alzheimer’s disease, tau is a major contributor to flortaucipir signal—but not the only one.” The researchers believe these findings can help clinicians avoid over-interpretation of borderline signal in a tau PET scan and improve how scans are used for prognosis and trial decisions.",

          "rawSummary": "Drug-resistant bacteria are becoming harder to treat, pushing scientists to look for new antibiotic targets. Researchers have now discovered that several unrelated viruses disable a key bacterial protein called MurJ, which is essential for building the bacterial cell wall. High-resolution imaging shows these viral proteins lock MurJ into a single position, stopping cell wall construction and leading to bacterial death.",
